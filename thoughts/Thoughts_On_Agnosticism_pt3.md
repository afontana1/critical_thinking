# Specific Philosophical Differences and Committments of an Agnostic

None of these are exclusive to agnosticism but I would say this very much charaterizes my sense of the word agnosticism, and particularly pertains to myself.


1. How vs. Why [Questions](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/questions/)
	- shift away from "Why" questions to "What" and "How"


2. Teleology vs. Mechanism


3. Rejection of Mind-Body Dualism (absence of a committment to some philosophical monism)


4. Desire to know How a thing works


5. View of animals (They are not automata) and nature


6. Committment to methods, not revelation or authority


7. Ontology precedes teleology


8. Historical Criticism, Linear History, Historiography


9. Abductive Reasoning, Bayesianism, acknowledgment if Inference to Best Explanation


10. Assumption Revision


11. Role of Metaphor in understanding, hesitance of narrarative techniques


12. Dedication to controlled trials, statistical experimentation, and principles of causal inference for explaining observable phenomenon


13. General lack of care for being "right" about deep metaphysical propositions that are far removed from practical application


14. Wants to understand processes and structure


15. Skeptical of Scripture, But open to it if archaeological evidence warrants it, or external sources confirm its claims


16. Tests basic assumptions of world views


17. Tipping points, phase transitions, and emergence are fundamental to understanding


18. Hyperaware of Cognitive Bias minimization


19. Evolution is not a belief, it is a very useful concept that is applicable to many domains 


20. Evidence is indeterminate, but we can rank different sources of evidence and their reliability for confidence in a conclusion (think of a murder trial or anything in law)


21. Very Socratic with their approach to life, the only thing they are certain of is that they arent certain of anything


22. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and possibly a theory backing the observations 


23. Sensitivity analysis applied to everything


24. Probably aware of the conditional nature of knowledge, the contingency of things, skeptical of metaphysical "necessary truths"


25. Not moved by aphorisms, words of wisdom, and can find exeptions easily to moral or ethical generalizations


26. Possibility is a very intruiging concept that gets them thinking. Definitions are not blindly accepted unless clearly demonstrable.
