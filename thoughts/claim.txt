Claim:
1) there exists some higher power/God/force that ensure people act in accordance with an ethical system even when no one is looking and you can get away with it. There will be some form of judgment. This prevents people from acting immorally, and holds them accountable to the code of conduct. 
2) If there were no higher force ensuring the behavior is in accordance with the law people would be more likely to break the code of conduct because they do not think there will be some form of authority judging them at some point in the future. 
3) There is no way to ensure concordance with an ethical system if there is no higher Entity or spirutual force punishing/judging people for their behavior. It serves to incentivize people to do the correct thing, according to a system of ethics, if there is higher level accountibility. 


Counter:
1) There exists other forms of accountability to ensure people act in concordance with an ethical system, that does not need to be a higher form of authority.
2) even if people believe that the higher force will judge them, history has shown people to still break moral codes. If its the case that both believers and non-believers can deviate from a moral code, then having belief in a higher form of authority will not guarentee ethical/moral behavior.
3) if you are agnostic/non-theistic, it does not follow that, because you do not beleive in the higher form of authority judging your decisions, that you will deviate from a system of principled/moral behavior. 


Problem:
If you are non-theistic, how can you ensure you do the right thing if there is no higher power judging you even when no one is around to make sure you are doing the right thing. 

Claim:
You do not need to have a conception of a higher authority to keep you in line, that is entirely up to the individual. History has shown conclusively for this to be the case. People of Faith and non-beleivers have both gone against a given moral code. The existence or non-existence of a belief in a higher authority does not necessarily guarentee or prevent a person from acting immoral in a given situation. Even if you share the same faith, and hence the same system of ethics, there have been cases of divide between denominations that have led to immoral behavior (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) or (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations). Some of the principles have been shown to not require a conception of God (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)
