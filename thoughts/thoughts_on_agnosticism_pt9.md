## Modern Argument from ignorance 



This is used when there is information a scientific paradigm initially did not know of at inception, but has nevertheless attempted to partially or fully compensate for without having to completely absolve themselves or the other known truths and facts entailed by the system, or axioms that are taken to be true in the system, or observational evidence procured by experiment verifying the paradigm to a specific degree 



- P1. Person X made a claim at time Y about some subject S, establishing some sort of general pattern or understanding from the observed facts

- P2. At time Y, the person did not know of the new information INFO and facts we have about S at time Y+N

- P3. New INFO needs to be explained by the existing general understanding/theory devised at time Y. There needs to be an ad hoc updating or revision to the general belief.

- P4. New INFO at time Y+1 cannot be reconciled with the original theory proposed before new facts were introduced (according to some criteria or standard we have for reconciliation)

- P5. (Hidden assumption) the new information can be explained by untested explanation E. Usually assumed as a dichotomy. Either the original postulate explains it in light of new information, or the null hypothesis which is assumed true and untested. 

- P6. (Assumed by the prosecution) there is no existing way to reconcile the new evidence (to their knowledge) and there is no possible way to reconcile (according to their presumed standards) (typically they take the presumption that their unproved position is the best default assumption without showing why it’s the best and is typically using some other argument scheme to conclude it) 

- P7. The new information shows that the original postulate/theory is insufficient (according to some epistemic standard for accepting something as a causal explanation, minimal criteria or maximal criteria)

- P8. If it is insufficient, or non universal, there must be absolutely no truth to it

- P9. All of the latter holds true 

- C. Therefore, this alternative (usually untested) explanation must be the source (ruling out any other possibilities and assuming a dilemma)



Example:



- P1. At the time Darwin postulated Evolution I’m biological systems by means of natural selection, he did not know of DNA

- P2. DNA is not fully explained for, ie: how it synthesized from proteins and amino acids, or how it configured complex biological systems 

- P3. New studies have shown that phenotype change and species evolution cannot fully be explained by natural selection (this is typically false)

- P4. Therefore there are explanatory gaps in the theory 

- P5. DNA is not well understood, but we know it instructs how life forms similar to how an engineer provides information for computing systems (or any other analogy)

- P6. The mechanism is not fully understood as to how DNA emerges, therefore it must be a creator 

- P7. If DNA accounts for changes in biological species not accounted for in original evolutionary theory, there must be some other driving force causing it

- P8. Things visually resembling an engineered process must have an engineer to do so

- C. Due to new information and our lack of understanding of how it fits into the original theory, there are explanatory gaps and therefore the default assumption of creation must be the reason
