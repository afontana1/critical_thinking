# Every Theological Interpretation of Scripture relies on resources external to the text itself

## Why you cant "just read your Bible"

If I "just read the bible" I immediately come to a halt when I see the words "let there be light" in Genesis I. We live on a planet. Planets cannot form without stars. Stars emit light. The form of the Earth cannot exist without the elements given to it from the sun, which implies light came before the earth was formed. It is a physically false claim. If i just read the bible, I come across this and think:

P1. If there are demonstrably false or innacurate claims, or claims that run contrary to known facts in a document, I will need additional support in order to accept the document, or to be able to act on it
	- this does not seem controversial. If i recieve a document from my manager with inconsistencies, vagueness, ambiguities, outright false claims etc. the most prudent thing to do would probably be to not act on the document or accept it
P2. If the additional support is in a form contrary to accepted standards of knowledge generation, or is in a way misleading or misguided by ideology, I should not accept it as supporting evidence. 
P3. P1 holds true of document X, so I need to look for additional support Y
P4. Additional support Y is not fullfilled by requirement set in P2.
C. I should not accept the document or act on its behalf


"That part of the bible is meant to be allegorical/parable or an exemplification of some idea X" may typically be the response. I can accept this, with limits however. If we take "parts" of the bible to be allegorical and other parts to be literal, what method is there to discern which should be treated as allegorical or literal? I can't think of a way to demarcate the boundary. Suppose I head the claim "Jesus rose from the dead", am I supposed to take that literally? Assume we can define each term in that sentence unambiguously and apply some verificationalist principle or subject it to other empirical methods, it would seem this is at best inconclusive and at most completely absurd because it goes against every common sense notion we have about factual reality. If i take it as allegory, what am I to do with it? 

P1. Document D needs to be analyzed to discern its truth value in terms of correspondence to observable facts
P2. You cannot subject claim X to some portion of document D to some standard S
P3. You subjected claim X to standard S
C. Your conclusion about the veracity is misguided


If the document is to be read allegorically, then we encounter the following components of an allegory: Character, plot, setting, theme, style, structure, form, genre, narration, and tense (possibly aspect as well). I now need to interpret it, while keeping these concepts in mind. This is called Exegesis (or [hermenuetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics) for the philosophically minded people) and a good example of parable would be the Good Samaritan. The methods we apply to the Allegory of the Cave, for example, could be useful here. Other interpretive methods from the legal discipline may be of use. More broadly, anything from literary theory can be used. This opens the door to textual criticism. We would need to be critical of the rehtorical methods being used to inflate claims. Now we run into questions such as "What could sentence S be referring to? In what sense does Paul imply X?". There could be infinitely many interpretations, some of which conflicting. The reading of the Bible becomes irreducibly complex and if we want to discern any meaning from it we should probably consider many of them. All of this is beside the point however, because we have simply obfuscated the question "What are the factual claims in the Bible and what are not?". Legal documents are a good analogy. Looking at some of the methods here [Statutory_interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation) can be mind opening how different interpretive methods lead to different rulings. The difference however, is that facts are represented not in an allegorical way, but in a chronological way and substantiated by expertise or forensics. The problem of interpretation comes when deciding how to apply the rules, not how to derive meaning from the case-in-question. Reading [Four Senses of Scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_senses_of_Scripture) can give a nice introduction to how people approach interpretation in biblical studies but the main take away is that the results will be indeterminate.

	- The bible (NT) is a collection of books, poems, notes, letters etc. Each gives an account into the life of Jesus. The account is a story/script/testimony of various fact claims; Each, with differing literary style (figures of speech, parables, narratives, allegories, fables, personifications, motifs) depending on the hermeneutical stance of the reader. In essence, we are looking at a collection of fragmented documents that are potentially parables or legends depending on the historicity of the claims, and their degree of correspondence with our everyday understanding of life (miracles vs improbable events, natural explanatons vs revelation) in our modern lense. 

	- Interpreting the scripture itself relies upon mental abstractions, interpretation techniques, linguistic analysis, conceptualizations, definitions, community reinforcing the interpretation, rhetorical strategies, philosophical doctrines/movements, and internal components of the text itself. It is common to see methods employed that originated external to the bible, and passages internal to the bible to explain another passage. 


P1. Passage P should be interpreted based on its (most likely) interpretation
	- Does plausibility or probability even apply when it comes to interpretation outside of a quantitative setting?
P2. Interpretation I is best among competing alternatives
C. P should be interpreted as I
(Assumption: Interpretation is an argumentative or authoritative procedure that is defeasible, filled with presumptions, and actually evolves according to its embedded context)


Interpretation can come from a variety of possible sources. One particular [Trope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)) we are all familiar with is that of [Augustinian Original Sin](https://www.vision.org/the-original-view-of-original-sin-1140). The dominant reading is that of St. Augustine but there was a competing view from Monk [Pelagius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagius) who essentially refuted Augustinian theology but was deemed a heretic, of which people have now renunciated these heretical accusations. 
The main idea is that philosophy/academia informs theology which informs religious interpretation.
