How does one acquire knowledge? How does one come to “know” a proposition or set of propositions is “True”? Take the claim: Joe is a male living around the corner. How does one verify he exists? I can go to his house. Maybe he’s not there. I can look in his mailbox for letters addressed to that name, they could be fake. I can reason that there must be a male living there who’s name is likely to be joe. I have methods for coming to know he exists, and they fall into two broad areas: sensory data or rational justification, typically a combination of both. To verify the claim or the hypothesis of existence I can use empirical information, evidence, reason defeasibly to the best possible explanation or conclusion, I can simulate his existence based on known parameters, I can look for auxiliary information that points to his existence etc.. The proposition is in principle demonstrable or provable. 



An atheist says “I do not need to justify the claim that God does not exist”. I disagree, but not sharply; the claim “God does not exist” can in principle be proven rationally, like how we prove certain numbers do not have certain properties in maths, and the negation of existence is a statement that can be proven with by contradiction or converse etc.. Maybe if you take the kantian approach that “existence “ cannot be a property of an entity, and henceforth cannot be proven to exist or not exist. 



Aside from rational argumentation, there are other ways to know about physical or latent entities in the observable world. Take “intelligence”, no one can observe this: it is a latent construct postulated from psychological theory and we can only observe its effects. We can set up experiments to test this, and depending on our conceptualization we can come to probablistic conclusions about the measure. We can also reason about what is to be expected of a physical system if some premises were to be true and then observe the systems behavior after conducting some sort of counter factual analysis and reason from the data that the assumptions are likely to be verified. But you cannot do this for god because by definition he is metaphysical, outside of the universe. All of our empirical sciences cannot demonstrably prove or disprove the existence of the entity, however conceived.



Back to rationality. There are hundreds of arguments for gods existence and just as many against his existence. The arguments vary depending on the conceptualization of god. And each argument, for or against, has faced rebuttles and in my opinion have not been conclusively demonstrated. Perhaps Godels theorem has something to do with my thoughts about purely rational systems. Nevertheless we are at a stand still with pure empiricism, rationalism, and a combination of the two. Which leads us to revelation or miracles.



My main problem with these arguments are that if omnipotence is an attribute of God then there should be at some level, a personal relationship with him by everyone, in varying degrees and the experiences may be different. People say they have experienced the divine but then I remember times where I think I have but then I can easily demonstrate that it was some sort of psychological bias or mind trick after I inspected further. People say “well it’s my truth”, and it immediately reminds me of the postmodernists who relativize knowledge based on their standpoint. That’s pretty much how I see miracle arguments; they are standpoint epistemology in the face of doubt. 



Suppose there is an argument that withstands refutation for a long time. Does that mean it’s true? There may be an orator who is skilled but unknown who can easily refute it. Perhaps voices are silenced. Perhaps I am just not smart enough to refute the claim but someone else is. Accepting the argument looks to be conditional on the quality of argument used to refute whatever the existing presupposition is; which is obviously connected to a host of factors including education level and access to resources. Can we actually say we know if 9/10 of Europeans in 1500 Europe are illiterate and can’t possibly have the capacity to rebut the existing dogma, and if they have the capacity they’re burned at the stake for heresy? 



It seems to me “god exists” or “god does not exist” is simply an unknowable metaphysical claim that shouldn’t prevent us from living good lives or drive us to hatred against those who disagree.
