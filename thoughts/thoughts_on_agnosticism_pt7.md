1. Godels incompleteness theorems for formal logical systems (the purest forms of reason) and undecideability
2. Limitations of sensory data and inconclusiveness from empirical/statistical data 
3. Unprovable background presuppositions
4. No direct access to anything metaphysical: the reasoning here is always defensible and subject to revision 
5. Rejection of standpoint epistemology as a means for asserting “personal truths”.
6. Hallucinations, alternative explanations for spiritual experiences; especially in light of experimental repeatability of the assumed act of supernatural experiences. The “spiritual sense”, maybe some people are attuned to a spirituality that can somehow be perceived in a way we don’t understand yet. But if it’s a type of perception then how are we sensing the incoming information? I process visual information with my eyes; which organ is responsible for spiritual senses? How is it possible for one human to have the experience but not another?
7. Every argument being inconclusive.
8. Fundamental limitations of every mean and method we use to acquire knowledge short of definitions and assumption
9. It is an assertion of the impossibility of knowing without a doubt some claim to be true. This is the case for examples beyond theism.
10. It is more than stating that “both sides have not met the burden of proof”. It is a statement that the burden of proof cannot be ascertained or agreed upon for a variety of arguments or cases for each side in contention. It asks “how do we know?” Then proceeds to demonstrate how our methods of knowledge acquisition fail for specific grand claims
11. Self referential: in ethics, existence, knowledge generation etc. at some point systems become self referential, they depend on themselves and produce more of themselves but cannot be verified externally. Present in many arguments for god, depending on the conceptualization of him.
12. Our best formal systems are necessarily incomplete, these are the only way we have come to precise unambiguous knowledge. Human reasoning is highly informal and defeasible.
13. No Free Lunch theorem and Humes problem of induction
