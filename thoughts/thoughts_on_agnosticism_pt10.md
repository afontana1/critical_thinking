## Free will

There seems to be a combination of deterministic and indeterministic aspects to it. If I look at the grand scale, it looks to be deterministic at that level. The outcome is predetermined. If I look locally, I have complete free will to an extent such that I am limited by prior decisions that are still effecting me at this moment but their importance tapers away similar to autocorrelation in a regression. If I look at my social context it looks like I have relative control over the situation, while at a broader scale there are institutional and cultural factors I am born into which predispose me to certain paths and decisions and limit my opportunity set. My will appears to be limited and influenced by many factors including history and the physical environment but I can nonetheless change my mind in unpredictable ways if I choose. Collectively we are bound but also at the collective level there seems to be a lot of chaos and pure randomness that can come from sensitivity in the initial conditions.
